                    <p>Fushimi is easily the best AYCE sushi in Toronto (that I have been to so far at least!) They have great service and some of the best salmon nigiri I've ever had. The menu has a lot of variety, and the a la carte menu isn't too shabby either (if you don't feel like eating 30 pieces in one sitting!) The first time we went was on New Years Day 2016 - the place we wanted to go to wasn't answering the phone and we presumed them closed. So we called up Fushimi and they answered on the first ring (a New Year's Day Miracle!) we got there and we were <strong>stoked</strong>. The restaurant itself could pass as a more upscale place, and the service is so good that a waitor picked my scarf off the floor within seconds of it happening. Anyway, you won't be let down, but I still have a lot of the menu to try.</p>

                    <p>Went in with pretty low expectations, but boy was I surprised. Went one on one with a girlfriend, we started with fresh sushi and sashimi, with soups and salads. The salad was great cause they added cucumber and tomoato, instead of just giving you 3 pieces of iceberg and a scoop full of dressing. We then ordered some rolls, loved the red dragon cause it was shrimp instead of crab, and of course I liked the spicy salmon roll, even though it was pretty kinda dense. My friend had the rainbow roll and the california and finished all of them; I was thoroughly impressed. We kept it simple, but also ordered these mini sushi pizzas and spicy salmon nigiri. Definitely want to go back with more people to try more of the menu, but so far a success!</p>
        
                    <p>Went back here again with some friends for lunch - I think the dinner items are higher quality, my friends and I gave it a 6-7 out of 10, which actually isn't bad from an AYCE place in the middle of dundas square for $17. We ordered a ton of food and I have added the pictures here!</p>

                    <p>While this place qualifies under AYCE, I must admit that I ordered it on Foodora straight to my house for delivery. Both good options! It was pretty cheap atually, I must admit I couldn't eat all the food that was pictured :( The sushi was decent, still not sure if I would order again but it wasn't bad by any means. The dynamite roll had way too much mayo, but the spicy tuna and spicy salmon were a bit better in that regard. The spicy tuna had a really good flavour while the spicy salmon was a bit more bland. Might try again if I'm feeling risky, but if it a shot yourself and tell me what you think!</p>
        
                    <p>I gotta say though, the food was extremely photogenic! Enjoy!</p>

                    <p>If you're ever in the area, I highly suggest this place. It is fresh, it's usually pretty packed, and the price is... wait for it.. RIGHT. I've gone both for AYCE and take out, and it fares well both ways depending on your mood (or I guess depending on your group). Pictured below is some sort of fancy roll I ordered and I don't remember the name of, but it had some delicious red tuna with tempura bits and avocado - I mean does it GET any better?! Paired it with some spicy salmon, and here that means 8 pieces. EIGHT. My boyfriend had to help me eat all of them because this was supposed to be a light snack before our huge brunch and father's day feast. Try this place out though, you won't regret it!</p>

                    <p>Aji Sai is pretty hit or miss. It was my go-to AYCE sushi for a little while, but I always felt a little let down for some reason. The nigiri was always fresh, sometimes the rolls didn't hit the spot though. I once ordered a seaweed salad and it literally came in a ketchup container, we nearly ordered 12 of them after that and couldn't stop laughing. Lots of surprises at this place which at least keeps you and your friends laughing.</p>

                    <p>Decent sushi, I would say it's overpriced compared to the other places nearby ($20 for lunch?? Come on it's not <strong>that</strong> good) My go-to when I go there is the salmon sashimi avocado salad and the spring rolls. The nigiri is pretty fresh, the tempura is decent, and sometimes I just order an $8 salmon lovers special that hits the spot. The service is horrible though, they couldn't care less about your table. </p>
